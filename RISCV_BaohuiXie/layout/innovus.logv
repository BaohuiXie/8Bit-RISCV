Due to this restriction, the group_path constraint is not supported directly in the constraint files which are configured in mode-specific commands such as create_constraint_mode. The current group_path entry will be ignored. You can enter the group_path constraint interactively or as part of a general command script -  where it will be interpreted as global and will be in effect for all modes.
